It is responsible for rendering the user interface, managing state, and handling interactions with the 'Products-API-L' to fetch and display product data. This component ensures a responsive and intuitive user experience, fulfilling all container requirements.\", 'interfaces': '', 'algorithms': '', 'pseudocode': '', 'local_backend_service': [], 'asset_images_b64': {}, 'available_assets': []}",
